# alx-project-nexus

## Overview

This repository serves as a documentation hub for my major learnings throughout the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program**. It summarizes the concepts, technologies, and best practices that shaped my backend development skills.

The goal of this repository is to act as a central reference point—a place where I record what I’ve learned, reflect on challenges, and organize essential knowledge gained during the program.

## Key Technologies Covered

### Python

* Core syntax and best practices
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Error handling and testing
* Working with modules, virtual environments, and package management

### Django

* MVT architecture
* Models, Views, Templates
* Django ORM queries
* Authentication and permissions
* Middleware and signals

### REST APIs

* Django REST Framework (DRF) fundamentals
* Serializers, viewsets, routers
* Pagination, filtering, throttling
* Authentication (JWT, session-based)
* API documentation and testing

### GraphQL

* Graphene-Django basics
* Schemas, queries, mutations
* Data resolving techniques

### Docker

* Creating Dockerfiles
* Building and running containers
* Docker Compose for multi-service apps
* Containerizing Django applications

### CI/CD

* Automated testing
* Automated deployments
* GitHub Actions workflows

## Important Backend Development Concepts

### Database Design

* Normalization and relationships
* Indexing and query optimization
* Migrations and schema management
* PostgreSQL best practices

### Asynchronous Programming

* Async/await fundamentals
* When to use async in backend systems
* Understanding event loops and concurrency models

### Caching Strategies

* Using Redis
* Caching API responses
* Improving performance with in-memory systems
* Cache invalidation methods

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

* **Complex ORM queries** → Solved by breaking queries down and mapping to raw SQL.
* **Structuring large Django projects** → Adopted modular architecture and followed established best practices.
* **Debugging authentication issues (JWT)** → Utilized Postman, DRF API browser, and logging.
* **Containerization difficulties** → Practiced with small Dockerized apps before handling the main project.

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

* Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
* Break large systems into smaller, manageable modules.
* Validate inputs and sanitize data consistently.
* Use version control properly: commit early, commit often.
* Communicate with teammates clearly and regularly.
* Test thoroughly: unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases.
* Continue learning—technology evolves, but core principles remain essential.

## Collaboration

### With Whom?

* **ProDev Backend Learners**: Exchange ideas, pair-program, and share insights.
* **ProDev Frontend Learners**: Collaborate closely as they will consume backend APIs.

### Where?

* **Discord Channel:** `#ProDevProjectNexus`

  * Share progress
  * Ask questions
  * Stay updated with announcements

## ProDev Tip

During **Week 1**:

* Announce which project you are building.
* Identify frontend learners working on the same project.
* Align requirements early to ensure smooth collaboration.
